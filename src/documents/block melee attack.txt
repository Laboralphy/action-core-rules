Bloquer une attaque de mélée
----------------------------

Jet de compétence :
REF + Compétence + 1 >= Jet d'attaque

Jet réussi :
attaque parée
+4 INI pour la prochaine attaque de cet attaquant
+2 DEF contre attaque de mélée pendant 1 tour

To Block a HTH or melee attack, the character must make a
successful skill roll, using his REF + appropriate combat skill +1.
If the effect number of the Block roll is equal to or greater than
the effect number of the attacker’s skill roll, the attack has been
blocked and the blocking character gains a +4 to his INI against
his attacker on the next turn. This INI bonus does not apply to
actions against characters other than the attacker whose attack
was blocked.
Characters who are blocking a melee attack receive a bonus
of +2 to their DEF against melee attacks, but no bonus against
ranged attacks. This bonus lasts until their next action.
